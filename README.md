# Next.js Material Ui Starter Kit


[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a React framework for developing single page Javascript applications. The benefits of this framework are numerous, both for our clientsâ€™ applications as well as for our development team. The more we, as users, interact digitally, the more impatient we become as our expectations are not met by websites and apps that fail to load within milliseconds. Technology decisions play a large part in being able to deliver highly performant, scalable, successful applications and as such, we have started using Next.js for a number of reasons; for the most part related to speed and performance.
 
 
 [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) is simply a library that allows us to import and use different components to create a user interface in our React applications. This saves a significant amount of time since the developers do not need to write everything from scratch
